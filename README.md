# Logistic-Model-Inference
This repository demonstrates the implementation of LiVE method proposed in 

Guo Z, Rakshit P, Herman DS, Chen J (2019). “Inference for Case Probability in High-dimensional
Logistic Regression.”

"LF_logistic" contains all the source functions.

"Example_LF_logistic" gives a simulated data example to conduct statistical inference for linear functional in high dimensional logistic regression with the source file "LF_logistic".
